I am currently deepening my skills in Red Teaming and have a keen interest in Active Directory. My passion lies in creating and writing my own tools, and I am currently developing several projects using Golang.
Outside of coding, I enjoy creating detailed, diagram-based notes and designing cybersecurity-themed stickers. I actively participate in CTFs to sharpen my skills and am deeply interested in low-level programming.</description></item></channel></rss>
