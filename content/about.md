I'm a security and tech enthusiast with a strong focus on offensive security. I am currently deepening my skills in Red Teaming and have a keen interest in Active Directory. My passion lies in creating and writing my own tools, and I am currently developing several projects using Golang.

Outside of coding, I enjoy creating detailed, diagram-based notes and designing cybersecurity-themed stickers. I actively participate in CTFs to sharpen my skills and am deeply interested in low-level programming.

If you have any query or feedback, feel free to [connect](mailto:shuklasameep16@gmail.com).
